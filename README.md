# OpenGaia

OpenGaia is a GIS based on [openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) databases.
It's intended as a practical way to re-render OSM maps to enable graphical and data manipulation.

## Installation

Download from source, build with Gradle and run the main.
You'll find all the dependencies inside build.gradle.

## Usage

Outside src there should be some files I haven't uploaded due to data protection reasons.
There should be two folders named respectively "landuse_textures" containing all the textures
for the landuse data, and the same thing goes for the "leisure_textures" folder. 
To use this software, you will have to go to [openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)
and manually download a map tile of the region you want to render.
